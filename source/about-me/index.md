##Bio##
I'm a security practitioner and independent software engineer with experience in many different languages including Python, Java, C, Ada and many others. I've been developing software for about 7 years including 3 years working on projects professionally. I have experience developing on and for all platorms (Windows, Mac, *nix) and have written apps for both iPhone and Android.

In addition to my experience in software design I have experience in information security and that is my main area of interest. 

##Extra Curriculars##
I am the captain of Western Washington University's Collegiate Cyber Defense Team, which took first in the [Pacific Rim Regional Cyber Defense Competition](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023462131_westerncyberxml.html) and went on to take 4th in the national competiton. Following the competition I had a security practice internship with Splunk helping to develop security software for them.

I am also a founding member of the [DevOps club at WWU](https://github.com/WWUDevOps). This is a club designed to help fill in the gap between academia and industry by exposing them to the devops way of doing things and new technologies emerging in industry (e.g. Vagrant).
