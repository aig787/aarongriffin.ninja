Whether you've been using git for source control for years or have never touched it before chances are it can do something you didn't know about. I recently heard about [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com) and can't recommend it enough. It tackes you from the very basics to more complex topics like gitd and rebasing with a series of easy to follow labs that you can do entirely on your own machine.
